Investing is a way to set aside money while you are busy with life and have that money work for you so that you can fully reap the rewards of your labor in the future. Investing is a means to a happier ending. Legendary investor Warren Buffett defines investing as "…the process of laying out money now to receive more money in the future." The goal of investing is to put your money to work in one or more types of investment vehicles in the hopes of growing your money over time.


What is the stock market for?

The role of the stock market is to provide a venue for investors to buy and sell individual company shares, funds or other financial products. The stock market enables those interactions using the mechanism of price discovery based on fundamental and technical analysis. Changes in share prices allow investors to buy or sell financial products they are interested in owning.

What is risk?

When it comes to investing, risk can be broadly defined as the probability of increasing or decreasing capital. Every investment opportunity carries the inherent chance of improving or worsening the value of the initial capital sum. The implied chance of a profit or loss defines the investment risk. Investments in some companies are said to be riskier than in others. That could be due to how well established the company is, how it is managed, how well it can access debt in order to expand or survive. Or it could be the success of its products or how nimble it is in the face of changes in demand for its products.


How does Stock-C help?

If you’re not well-versed in the basics of the stock market, the stock trading information spewing from Business News or the markets section of your favorite newspaper can border on gibberish. Phrases like “earnings movers” and “intraday highs” don’t mean much to the average investor, and in many cases, they shouldn’t. If you’re in it for the long term — with, say, a portfolio of funds geared toward retirement — you don’t need to worry about what these words mean, or about the flashes of red or green that cross the bottom of your TV screen. You can get by just fine without understanding the stock market much at all.
If, on the other hand, you want to learn how to trade stocks, you do need to understand the stock market, and at least some basic information about how stock trading works.

But no one can become a master trader or investor in a few days. It takes lot of time and research to make low risk financial decisions.  But what if you had something to support your decisions? Stock-C is a python program that will support you in decision making and offer other guidelines. Whether you are shorting the market, or investing on stocks for years to come, Stock-C has got your back.
